My code is in StaffordBot.py. I also created an opening book and attached a tablebase but to reduce the size of the repo, these are not included. Also the token in the config is hidden so it is impossible to access my bot account. When the bot is running, it can be challenged at https://lichess.org/StaffordBOT
